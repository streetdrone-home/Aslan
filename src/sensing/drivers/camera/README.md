### Camera Drivers

This directory contains all the drivers for the cameras, Project ASLAN is supporting. Most drivers require additional packages to be installed separately, otherwise the build will fail. The CMAKE is skipping the build on these packages.

#### Build
In order to build any camera driver, delete the file: "CATKIN_IGNORE" from its directory. Then follow the instructions as described on the READMEs.

##### 1. pointgrey_camera_driver
First install the camera driver.
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-pointgrey-camera-driver
```
To build this package individually:
```
catkin build pointgrey_camera_driver
OR
catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps pointgrey_camera_driver #if you have previously built your workspace with catkin_make
```

To run this camera package in the terminal use the following command:

```
roslaunch pointgrey_camera_driver camera.launch
```
